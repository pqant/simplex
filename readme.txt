This is a Simplex solver I wrote back in 2008 as part of a hobby project. Actually
some of the code was written during my flight from Seattle to Las Vegas. I think it 
took 2-3 hours to get this part working. Kudos to my brother Muzaffer Kapanoglu 
who explained how Simplex works in detail so I could write this.

NOTE: This is not tested thoroughly. As you can see in the code "minimization" is not
supported at all. I provide this to open source community mostly for educational 
purposes. Think of it as a base to start with. 

I planned to add some tests to this but did not have time for last year so instead
I wanted to release this as is and provide improvements later.
